# A Jack machine
A virtual machine in C and simple HDL, designed from the ground up

This is a project I created while following the book http://nand2tetris.org/, where a simple machine is built starting from a NAND gate and a flip-flop, implementing all main CPU modules, designing an ISA, then an assembly language, a Java-like intermediate language, and then a Java-like OOP language called Jack, include the assembler and compiler required.

I have then written a Space Invaders game in that language: https://github.com/obiwanus/machine/tree/master/jack/invaders
